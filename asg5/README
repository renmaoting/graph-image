This assignment mainly add five functions
1. ImageData* Manipulation::simpleTM(ImageData* inputImage, float gamma)
    This function is in manipulation.h and manipulation.cpp, you can run this function by the following command:
        ./tonemap -g 0.4 Ocean.exr simple.png
    Also you can change the lammda by the key up and down

2. ImageData* Manipulation::toneMapping(ImageData* inputImage, int flag, int c, int kSize)
    This function is in manipulation.h and manipulation.cpp, you can run this function by the following command:
        ./tonemap -c Ocean.exr covWithC.png
    You can change the value of C by key up and down.

3. ImageData* Manipulation::toneMapping(ImageData* inputImage, int flag, int c, int kSize)
    This function will tone mapping with different filter, the second parameter is a flag, when it is 0, it means
        tone mapping with box filter, when it is 1, it means that it will use a bilateral filter.
    You can run this function by the following command:
        ./tonemap -b Ocean.exr bilateral.png

4. ImageData* Manipulation::biFilt(ImageData* inputImage, int kSize)
    This function can generate a Gausian filter and then apply it to log(Lw). The second parameter is the size of filter.

5. ImageData* Manipulation::globalOpt(ImageData* inputImage , float a)
    This function implement Reinhard's global operator. You can run this function by the following command:
        ./tonemap -a Ocean.exr global.png
    You can adjust the value of A by key up and down
    

You can switching between the original and tone mapped image by pressing the s or S 

The best image created by the first two action is "simple.png", it is created by simple tone mapping, in this function, when lammda around 0.4 will generate better result.

The best image created by bilateral is "bilateral.png", when the 'C' around 50, you can get a better result.
